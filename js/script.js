Additional Process Thoughts:
- If I were to expand more on this project my idea would be to use a *Python* script to scrape the date from the quotes URL listed below. 
- Then convert that information into a JSON file that would then be populated into the 'quotes' array
- I believe this idea is sound, and an even better way to scrape through data & gather 100 quotes from the URL 
- That would eliminate a lot of typing, because adding 100 quotes manually would be grueling! 
- Unfortunately, that augmented progress is a bit out of the scope of my current knowledge, or at least it would take me much, much, much longer to complete.

// CHANGE BACKGROUND COLOR ON-CLICK

/*
I created a backgroundRandom function that will generate the numbers for the 'rgb()'
syntax that allows the CSS style property to be altered. 

These values were generated by using the following method:
Math.floor(Math.random() * 256)

These are then stored to three different variables r, g, and b. 
Those three values are then concatenated into a string, that's within a variable called 'finalColor' 

*/

  var r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
  var g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
  var b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
  var finalColor = 'rgb(' + r + ',' + g + ',' + b + ')';
  return finalColor;
}

  var newColor = backgroundRandom();
  document.body.style.background = newColor;
